# Energy Usage Analysis

![co-serv-dash][dashboard]
*an energy usage dashboard provided by my service provider.*

At the time of writing this repo, I had an electric provider called [CoServ
Electric][co-serv], a not-for-profit rural electric utility cooperative that services much
of North Texas. When moving in to the home that I was in, CoServ was my only
option. Now that I've decided to move, I went through all the new options that
are provided to me and I immediately thought back to the dashboard above.

In Texas, many providers offer promotional deals like Free Nights or Half-Price
timeframes in order to incentivize you as a consumer to choose them over their
competitors. With so many options and deals, there's usually money left on the
table (or in the meter!). I spent a couple of hours putting together an
analysis of my own energy usage over the course of my time at my current home
in hopes that it would save me some cash down the road.

I do my best to explain new concepts and functions, but I will assume that
you have a basic understanding of data structures, visualization, and analysis.
