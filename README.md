# Energy Usage Analysis

In the coming couple of months, I will be moving to a new home and as
such, will be switching a number of resource providers. Everyone loves
to save money, so I decided to see where I could cut costs.

My new home has access to three different providers: [__TXU__][1],
[__Reliant__][2], and [__GreenMountain__][3]\*. Of these three, TXU
seems to offer the most attractive pricing and flexible plans.. however
they also offer distinct benefits for each of their plans! The analysis
I undergo in this notebook will help me determine which plan is best to
choose, based on my own energy needs.
